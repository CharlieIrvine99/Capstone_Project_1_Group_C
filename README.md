 Interactive Quiz for Capstone Project 1

# Link to the replit

The timer we created sometimes doesn't work in certain IDEs, we know it works in Repl, VSCode and Python.

On the repl there is also an existing folder of highscores. But the code with create a new file called highScores.csv to save your highscore.

# The task at hand
In this project, we will create an interactive quiz game using Python.
The game will present a series of questions to the player, track their score, and provide feedback on their performance. 
The player will be able to select their answers and receive immediate results.

The objective of our Interactive Quiz Game project is to give an engaging and educational experience using our knowledge of Python. 
The project aims to provide an interactive learning experience for players while practicing Python programming concepts.

By completing this project, we will:
1. Gain hands-on experience in Python programming.
2. Learn to design and implement a quiz game with interactive features.
3. Understand how to handle user input and validate answers.
4. Practice working with data structures, such as lists or dictionaries, to store
and manage quiz questions.
5. Develop skills in implementing loops, conditionals, and score tracking
mechanisms.
6. Enhance their ability to provide feedback and display results based on user
interaction.
7. Gain familiarity with optional enhancements such as timers, difficulty levels,
and high scores.
8. Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking skills through designing
and implementing a functional game.

We will implement:
1. Questions and Answers: Prepare a collection of questions and their
corresponding answers. Each question should have multiple choices,
with only one correct answer.
2. User Interaction: Allow the user to select their answer choice for each
question. Provide clear instructions on how to input their answer (e.g.,
by typing the corresponding letter or number).
3. Scoring and Feedback: Keep track of the player's score throughout the
quiz. Provide immediate feedback after each question, indicating
whether their answer was correct or incorrect. Display the final score
at the end of the quiz.
4. Timer (Optional): For an additional challenge, you can incorporate a
timer for each question. Allow the player a limited amount of time to
answer each question and display how much time they have
remaining. (High level Challenge)
5. Difficulty Levels (Optional): Implement different difficulty levels for the
questions. Assign varying point values to each question based on the
difficulty level, providing a more dynamic scoring system.
6. High Scores (Optional): Store and display high scores to create a
competitive element in the game. Allow players to compare their
scores with previous players or themselves.
